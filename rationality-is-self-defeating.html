<p>Many blockchain and cryptocurrency fans seem to prefer building and analyzing
decentralized systems in a rational or “greedy behavior” failure model, rather
than a Byzantine or “arbitrary behavior” failure model. Many of the same
blockchain and cryptocurrency fans also like open, permissionless systems like
Bitcoin and Ethereum, which anyone can join and participate in using weak
identities such as anonymous cryptography key pairs.</p>

<p>What most of these heavily-overlapping sets of fans do not seem to realize,
however, is that rationality assumptions are self-defeating in open
permissionless systems with weak identities. A fairly simple metacircular
argument – a kind of
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">Gödel’s incompleteness theorem</a>
for rationality” – shows that for any system <em>S</em> that makes <em>any</em> behavioral
assumption, including but not limited to a rationality assumption, a rational
attacker both exists and <em>has an incentive</em> to defeat that behavioral
assumption, thereby violating that assumption and exhibiting Byzantine behavior
from the perspective of the system.</p>

<p>As a quick summary of the argument we will expand below, suppose a
permissionless system like Bitcoin is secure against rational attacks, but has
some weakness against irrational Byzantine attacks in which the attacker would
lose money. Because the system is open, permissionless, and exists within a
larger ecosystem, a rational attacker can find ways to “bet against” Bitcoin’s
security in <em>other</em> financially-connected systems (e.g., Ethereum), making a
profit <em>outside of</em> Bitcoin on this attack against Bitcoin. An attack that
appears irrational in the context of Bitcoin may be perfectly rational in the
context of the larger ecosystem.</p>

<p>For this reason, an open permissionless system designed to be secure only
against rational adversaries is actually just <em>insecure</em>, unless it remains
secure even when the “rational” participants become fully Byzantine. Given this,
one might as well have designed the permissionless system in a Byzantine model
in the first place. The rationality assumption offers no actual benefit, but
merely can make an insecure system appear secure under flawed analysis.</p>

<p>This blog post is based partly on ideas in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191124192837/https://bdlt.school/files/slides/talk-rainer-b%C3%B6hme-a-primer-on-economics-for-cryptocurrencies.pdf">Rainer Böhme’s talk</a>
at the recent
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416231544/https://bdlt.school/">BDLT Summer School in Vienna</a>.
While formalizing the argument would require some effort, we thought it would be
worth at least sketching the argument intuitively for the public record.</p>

<h2 id="threat-modeling-honest-byzantine-and-rational-participants">Threat Modeling: Honest, Byzantine, and Rational Participants</h2>

<p>In designing or analyzing the security of any decentralized system, we must
define the system’s <em>threat model</em>, and in particular our assumptions about the
behaviors of the participants in the system. An <em>honest</em>, <em>correct</em>, or
<em>altruistic</em> participant is one that we assume to follow the system’s protocol
rules as specified, hence representing a “well-behaved” participant exhibiting
no adversarial behavior.</p>

<p>A <em>Byzantine</em> participant, named after the
<a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~trevisan/cs174/byzantine.pdf">Byzantine Generals Problem</a>,
is one we make <em>no</em> assumptions about. A Byzantine participant can behave in
<em>arbitrary</em> fashion, without restriction, and hence by definition represents the
strongest possible adversary.</p>

<p>We would like to build systems that could withstand <em>all</em> participants being
Byzantine, but this appears fundamentally impossible. We therefore in practice
have to make threshold security assumptions, such as that over two-thirds of the
participants in classic Byzantine consensus protocols are honest, or that the
participants controlling over half the hashpower in Bitcoin are well-behaved.</p>

<p>Even with threshold assumptions, however, building systems that resist Byzantine
behavior is extremely difficult, and the resulting systems are often much more
complex and inefficient than systems tolerating weaker adversaries. We may
therefore be tempted to improve a design’s simplicity or efficiency by making
stronger assumptions about the behavior of adversarial participants, effectively
weakening the assumed adversary.</p>

<p><img src="https://bford.info/2019/09/23/rational/adversaries.svg" alt="Types of adversaries" /></p>

<p>One such popular assumption, especially in economic circles, is <em>rationality</em>.
In essence, we assume that rational participants may deviate from the rules in
arbitrary ways but <em>only when doing so is in their economic self-interest</em>,
improving their expected rewards – usually but not always financial – in
comparison with following the rules honestly.</p>

<p>By assuming that adversarial participants are rational rather than Byzantine, we
need not secure the system against <em>all</em> possible participant behaviors, such as
against participants who pay money with no reward merely to sow chaos and
destruction. Instead, we merely need to prove that the system is <em>incentive
compatible</em>, for example by showing that its rules represent a Nash equilibrium,
in which deviations from the equilibrium will not give participants a greater
financial reward.</p>

<p>Besides simplicity and efficiency, another appeal of rationality assumptions is
the promise of <em>strengthening</em> the system’s security by lowering the threshold
of participants we assume to be fully honest. To circumvent the classical
Byzantine consensus requirement that fewer than one third of participants may be
faulty, for example, we might hope to tolerate closer to 50%, or even 100%, of
participants being “adversarial” if we assume they are rational and not
Byzantine. Work on
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lorenzo/papers/sosp05.pdf">the BAR model (Byzantine-Altruistic-Rational)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lorenzo/papers/Abraham11Distributed.pdf"><em>(k,t)</em>-robustness</a>
exemplifies this goal, which sometimes appears achievable in closed systems with
strong identities. But a direct implication of our metacircular argument is that
an <em>open</em> system cannot generally be secure if all participants are either
Byzantine or rational.</p>

<h2 id="assumptions-underlying-the-argument">Assumptions Underlying the Argument</h2>

<p>The metacircular argument makes three main assumptions.</p>

<p>First, the system <em>S</em> under consideration is open and permissionless, allowing
anyone to join and participate in the system using only weak, anonymous
identities such as bare cryptographic key pairs. Identities in <em>S</em> need not even
be costless provided their price is modest: the argument still works even if <em>S</em>
imposes membership fees or requires new wallet keys to be “mined”, for example.
Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Proof-of-Stake
systems such as Algorand and Ouroboros, and most other permissionless systems
seem to satisfy this openness property. Because participation is open to anyone
globally and can be anonymous, we cannot reasonably expect police or governments
to protect <em>S</em> from attack: even if they wanted to and considered it their job,
they would not be able to find or discipline a smart rational attacker who might
be attacking from anywhere around the globe, especially from a country with weak
international agreements and extradition rules. Thus, <em>S</em> must “stand on its
own”, by successfully either withstanding or disincentivizing attacks coming
from anywhere. (And it will turn out that merely disincentivizing such attacks
is impossible.)</p>

<p>Second, the system <em>S</em> does not control a majority of total economic power or
value in the world: i.e., it is not totally economically dominant from a global
perspective. Instead, there may be (and probably are) actors outside of <em>S</em> who,
if rationally incentivized to do so, can at least temporarily muster an amount
of economic power outside of <em>S</em> comparable to or greater than the economic
value within or controlled by <em>S</em>. In other words, we assume that <em>S</em> is not the
“biggest fish in the ocean.” Given that there can be at most one globally
dominant economic system at a time, it seems neither useful nor advisable to
design systems that are secure only when they are the biggest fish in the ocean,
because almost always they are not.</p>

<p>Third, the system <em>S</em> actually <em>leverages</em> in some fashion the behavioral
assumption(s) it makes on participants, such as a rationality assumption. That
is, we assume there exist one or more (arbitrary) behavioral strategies that <em>S</em>
assumes some participants <em>will not</em> follow, such as economically-losing
behaviors in the case of rationality. Further, we assume there exists such an
assumption-violating strategy that will cause <em>S</em> to malfunction or otherwise
deviate observably from its correct operation. In fact, we need not assume that
this deviant behavior will <em>always</em> succeed in breaking <em>S</em>, but only that it
will non-negligibly <em>raise the probability</em> of <em>S</em> failing. If this were not the
case, and <em>S</em> in fact operates correctly, securely, and indistinguishably from
its ideal even if participants do violate their behavioral assumptions, then <em>S</em>
is actually Byzantine secure after all. In that case, <em>S</em> is not actually
benefiting from its assumptions about participant behavior, which are redundant
and thus may be simply discarded.</p>

<h2 id="the-metacircular-argument-rational-attacks-on-rationality">The Metacircular Argument: Rational Attacks on Rationality</h2>

<p>Suppose permissionless system <em>S</em> is launched, and operates smoothly for some
time, with all participants conforming to <em>S</em>’s assumptions about them. Because
<em>S</em> is permissionless (assumption 1) and exists in a larger open world
(assumption 2), new rational participants may arrive at any time, attracted by
<em>S</em>’s success and presumably growing economic value provided there is an
opportunity to profit from doing so.</p>

<p>Consider a particular newly-arriving participant <em>P</em>. <em>P</em> could of course play
by the rules <em>S</em> assumes of <em>P</em>, in which case the greatest immediate economic
benefit <em>P</em> could derive from participating in <em>S</em> is some fraction of the total
economic value currently embodied in <em>S</em> (e.g., its market cap). For most
realistic permissionless systems embodying strong founders’ or early-adopters’
rewards, if <em>P</em> is not one of the original founders of <em>S</em> but arrives
substantially after launch, then <em>P</em>’s near-term payoff prospectives from
joining <em>S</em> is likely bounded to a fairly <em>small</em> fraction of <em>S</em>’s total value.
But what if there were another strategy <em>P</em> could take, for perfectly <em>rational</em>
and economically-motivated reasons, by which <em>P</em> could in relatively short order
acquire a <em>large</em> fraction of <em>S</em>’s total value?</p>

<p><img src="https://bford.info/2019/09/23/rational/open-world.svg" alt="Open world with S and S'" /></p>

<p>Because <em>S</em> is permissionless and operating in a larger open world, <em>P</em> is not
confined to operating exclusively within the boundaries of <em>S</em>. <em>P</em> can also
make use of facilities external to <em>S</em>. By assumption 2, <em>P</em> may in particular
have access to, or be able to borrow temporarily, financial resources comparable
to or larger than the total value of <em>S</em>.</p>

<p>Suppose the facilities external to <em>S</em> include another Ethereum-like
cryptocurrency <em>S’</em>, which includes a smart contract facility with which
decentralized exchanges, futures markets, and the like may be implemented. (This
is not really a separate assumption because even if <em>S’</em> did not already exist,
<em>P</em> could create and launch it, given sufficient economic resources under
assumption 2.) Further, suppose that someone (perhaps <em>P</em>) has created on
external system <em>S’</em> a decentralized exchange, futures market, or any other
mechanism by which tokens representing shares of the value of <em>S</em> may be traded
or speculated upon in the context of <em>S’</em>: e.g., a series of tradeable Ethereum
tokens pegged to <em>S</em>’s cryptocurrency or stake units.</p>

<p>Now suppose participant <em>P</em> finds some behavioral strategy that system <em>S</em>
depends on participants <em>not</em> exhibiting, and that will observably break <em>S</em> –
or even that just <em>might</em> break <em>S</em> with significant non-negligible probability.
Assumption 3 above guarantees the existence of such a behavioral strategy,
unless <em>S</em>’s rationality assumptions were in fact redundant and worthless. <em>P</em>
must merely be clever enough to find and implement such a strategy. It is
possible this strategy might first require <em>P</em> to pretend to be one or more
well-behaved participants of <em>S</em> for a while, to build up the necessary
reputation or otherwise get correctly positioned in <em>S</em>’s state space; a bit of
patience and persistence on <em>P</em>’s part will satisfy this requirement. <em>P</em> may
also have to “buy into” <em>S</em> enough to surmount any entry costs or stake
thresholds <em>S</em> might impose; the external funds <em>P</em> can invoke or borrow by
assumption 2 can satisfy this requirement, and are bounded by the total value of
<em>S</em>. In general, <em>S</em>’s openness by assumption 1 and the existence of a
correctness-violating strategy by assumption 3 ensures that there exists some
course of action and supply of external resources by which <em>P</em> can position
itself to violate <em>S</em>’s behavioral assumption.</p>

<p>In addition to infiltrating and positioning itself within <em>S</em>, <em>P</em> also invokes
or borrows enough external funds and uses them to short-sell (bet against)
shares of <em>S</em>’s value massively in the context of the external system <em>S’</em>,
which (unlike <em>S</em>) <em>P</em> trusts will remain operational and hold its value
independently of <em>S</em>. Provided <em>P</em> reaches this short-selling position gradually
and carefully enough to avoid revealing its strategy early, the funds <em>P</em> must
invoke or borrow for this purpose must be bounded by some fraction of the total
economic value of <em>S</em>. And provided there are at least some participants and/or
observers of <em>S</em> who believe that <em>S</em> is secure and will remain operating
correctly, and are willing to bet to that effect on <em>S’</em>, <em>P</em> will eventually be
able to build its short position.</p>

<p>Finally, once <em>P</em> is positioned correctly within both <em>S</em> and <em>S’</em>, <em>P</em> then
launches its assumption-violating behavior in <em>S</em> that will observably cause <em>S</em>
to fail as per assumption 2. This might manifest as a denial-of-service attack,
a correctness attack, or in any other fashion. The only requirement is that
<em>P</em>’s behavior creates an <em>observable</em> failure, which a nontrivial number of the
existing participants in <em>S</em> believed would not happen because they believed in
<em>S</em> and its threat model. The fact that <em>S</em> is now observed to be broken, and
its basic design assumptions manifestly violated, causes the shares of <em>S</em>’s
value to drop precipitously on external market <em>S’</em>, on which <em>P</em> takes a
handsome profit. Perhaps <em>S</em> recovers and continues, or perhaps it fails
entirely – but either way, <em>P</em> has essentially transferred a significant
fraction of system <em>S</em>’s economic value from system <em>S</em> itself to <em>P</em>’s own
short-sold position on external market <em>S’</em>. And to do so, <em>P</em> needed only to
find a way – any way – to <em>surprise</em> all those who believed <em>S</em> was secure and
that its threat model accurately modeled <em>S</em>’s real-world participants.</p>

<p>Even if <em>P</em>’s assumption-violating behavioral strategy does not break <em>S</em> with
perfect reliability, but only with some probability, <em>P</em> can still create an
<em>expectation</em> of positive profit from its attack by hedging its bets
appropriately on <em>S’</em>. <em>P</em> does not need a perfect attack, but merely needs to
possess the <em>correct</em> knowledge that <em>S</em>’s failure probability is much higher
than the other participants in <em>S</em> believe it to be – because only <em>P</em> knows
that (and precisely when) it will violate <em>S</em>’s design assumptions to create
that higher failure probability. Furthermore, even if <em>P</em>’s attack fails, and
the vulnerability it exploits is quickly detected and patched, <em>P</em> may still
profit marginally from the market’s adjustment to a realization that <em>S</em>’s
failure probability was (even temporarily) higher than most of <em>S</em>’s
participants thought it was.</p>

<p>Within the context of system <em>S</em>, <em>P</em>’s behavior manifests as Byzantine
behavior, specifically violating the assumptions <em>S</em>’s designers thought
participants would not exhibit and thus excluded from <em>S</em>’s threat model.
Considered in the larger context of the external world in which <em>S</em> is embedded,
however, including the external trading system <em>S’</em>, <em>P</em>’s behavior is perfectly
rational and economically-motivated. Thus, the very rationality of <em>P</em> in the
larger open world is precisely what motivates <em>P</em> to break, and profit from,
<em>S</em>’s ill-considered assumption that its participants would behave rationally.</p>

<h2 id="implications-for-practical-systems">Implications for Practical Systems</h2>

<p>This type of financial attack is by no means entirely theoretical or limited to
fully-digital systems such as cryptocurrencies. In our scenario, <em>P</em> is
essentially playing a game closely-analogous to the investors in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap">credit default swaps</a> who
both contributed to, and profited handsomely from, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">2007-2008 financial crisis</a>,
as covered more recently in the film
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film)">The Big Short</a>.</p>

<p>In the cryptocurrency space, some real-world attacks we are seeing – such as
increasingly-common
<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/prolific-51-attacks-crypto-verge-ethereum-classic-bitcoin-gold-feathercoin-vertcoin/">51% attacks</a>
– might be viewed as special cases of this metacircular attack on rationality.
It is often claimed that large proof-of-work miners (or proof-of-stake holders)
will not attempt 51% attacks because doing so would undermine the value of the
cryptocurrency in which they by definition hold a large stake, and hence would
be “irrational”. But this argument falls apart if the attack allows the large
stakeholder to reap rewards outside the attacked system, e.g., by defrauding
exchanges or selling <em>S</em> short in other systems.</p>

<p>Externally-motivated attacks on cryptocurrencies have been predicted before in
the form of
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2041492">virtual protest or “Occupy Bitcoin” attacks</a>,
<a href="https://www.econinfosec.org/archive/weis2013/papers/KrollDaveyFeltenWEIS2013.pdf">Goldfinger attacks</a>,

<a href="https://fc18.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/bitcoin18-final17.pdf">hostile blockchain takeovers</a>,
and out-of-band variants of
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/775.pdf">pay-to-win attacks</a>. All these attacks
are specific instances of our argument. They have been presented in the
literature as open yet solvable challenges. We are not aware, however, of any
prior attempt to summarize the lessons learned and formulate a general
impossibility statement.</p>

<p>For most practical systems, we do not even know if they are incentive compatible
in the absence of an external system <em>S’</em> – i.e., where assumption 2 is violated
– and probably they are not. Almost all game-theoretic treatments of (parts of)
the Bitcoin protocol deliver negative results. Many attacks against specific
cryptocurrency system designs are known to be profitable in expectation, such as
<a href="https://www.avivz.net/pubs/12/Bitcoin_EC0212.pdf">ransaction withholding</a>,

rarely observe such attacks in large deployed systems. Many specific attacks do
not even depend on assumption 1, underlining the fact that rationality is not a
silver bullet even where this metacircular argument does not apply. Where it
does apply, it is more general and effectively <em>guarantees</em> the existence of
attacks against <em>all</em> open systems that assume participants are rational.</p>

<p>Another related observation is that financial markets on derivatives of a system
<em>S</em> mature in the external world (e.g., <em>S’</em>) as <em>S</em> grows and becomes more
relevant. So in some sense, systems built on the rationality assumption are
temporarily more secure only until they become fat enough targets to be eaten by
their own success. We can see this effect, for example, in the growing and
increasingly liquid market for hash power, which effectively thwarts
<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Nakamoto’s</a>
(<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48071-4_10">or Dwork’s</a>) rule
of thumb that the ratio of processors to individuals varies in a small band.
Such dynamics happen in the real world, too. But there they have traditionally
taken centuries or decades while in cryptocurrency space everything happens in
time-lapse.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-of-the-argument">Limitations of the Argument</h2>

<p>This argument is of course currently only a rough and informal sketch. An
enterprising student might wish to try formalizing it, or maybe someone has
already done so but we are unaware of it.</p>

<p>The metacircular argument certainly does not apply to all cryptocurrencies or
decentralized systems. In a permissioned system, for example, in which a closed
group of participants are strongly-identified and subject to legal and
contractual agreements with each other, one can hope that the threat of lawsuits
for arbitrarily-large damages will keep rational participants incentivized to
behave correctly. Similarly, in a national cryptocurrency, which might be
relatively open but only to citizens of a given country, and which require
verified identities with which the police can expect to track down and jail
misbehaving participants, this metacircular argument does not necessarily apply.</p>

<p>Apart from police enforcement, rationality assumptions may be weakened in other
ways to circumvent the metacircular argument. For example, an open system might
be designed according to a “weak rationality” assumption that users need
incentives to join the system in the first place (e.g., mining rewards in
Bitcoin), but that after having become stakeholders, most will then behave
honestly. In this case, rational incentives serve only as a tool for system
growth, but become irrelevant and equivalent to a strong honesty assumption in
terms of the internal security of the system itself.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-irrationality-can-be-rational">Conclusion: Irrationality Can Be Rational</h2>

<p><img src="https://bford.info/2019/09/23/rational/adversaries-open.svg" alt="Types of adversaries" /></p>

<p>What many in the cryptocurrency community seem to want is a system that is both
permissionless and tolerant of strongly-rational behavior – either beyond the
thresholds a similar a Byzantine system would tolerate (such as a rational
majority), or by deriving some simplicity or efficiency benefit from assuming
rationality. But in an open world in which the permissionless system is not the
only game in town, a potential <em>perfectly rational</em> attacker can always exist,
or appear at any time, whose entirely rational behavior is precisely to profit
from bringing the system down by violating its assumptions on participant
behavior.</p>

<p>So if you think you have designed a permissionless decentralized system that is
cleverly secured based on rationality assumptions, you haven’t. You have merely
obfuscated the rational attacker’s motive and opportunity to profit outside your
system from breaking your rationality assumptions. The only practical way to
eliminate this threat appears to be either to close the system and require
strong identities and police protection, or else secure the system against
arbitrary Byzantine behavior, thereby rendering rationality assumptions
redundant and useless for security.</p>
