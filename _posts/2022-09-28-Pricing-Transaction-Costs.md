### Gas Pricing Notes and Suggestions

Carrying over from the issues we have:

1. DO NOT TRACK GAS USED VIA WRAPPER: gas used through a wrapper contract is not accurate with Multicall due to EIP-2929

> This is probably the source of alot of issues TBH wrt gas price estimation. 

> V3 = Trident
> V2 = SushiV1 


For each gas estimate, normalize decimals to that of the chosen `usd token`.

Use the BFS approach. It allows us to keep a reference to nodes that we want to come back to, even though we havenâ€™t checked/visited them yet. This is crucial in both pathfinding and gas pricing, which is elaborated below.

1. First we seed BFS (breadth first search) queue with the best quotes for each percentage.
i.e. best quote when sending 10% of amount, best quote when sending 20% of amount, ...]
2. Then will explore the various combinations from each node.
- Size of the queue at this point is the number of potential routes we are investigating for the given number of splits.
- If we didn't improve our quote by adding another split, very unlikely to improve it by splitting more after that.

 3. For all other percentages, add a new potential route.
 - E.g. if our current aggregated route if missing 50%, we will create new nodes and add to the queue for:
 - 50% + new 10% route, 50% + new 20% route, etc.


4. [Calculate] 
            if on L1, the estimated gas used based on hops and ticks across all the routes
            if on L2, the gas used on the L2 based on hops and ticks across all the routes
            
5. If swapping on an L2 that includes a L1 security fee, calculate the fee and include it in the gas adjusted quotes
6. [check] ensure any addresses are aliased if needed for L2>L1
     
7. [assert] Ensure the `gasModel` exists and that the swap route is a v3 only route


8. Include a `networkCongestion` property when requesting EIP-1559-compatible gas fee estimates. 
This value, which is a number from 0 to 1, where 0 represents "not congested" and 1 represents "extremely congested", can be used to communicate the status of the overall network to the DApp and end user.

## Gwei Service

The Gwei Service is an important part of the overall system. Since Gwei pricing is the most important portion of the overall system efficacy it is decoupled from the application itself and run in a separate stack entirely. We inject the Gwei pricing service by  loading at runtime via `startGasWorker()`. _note_ we use the term GasWorker to draw a distinction between `gwei` and `gas`. Whereas `gwei` is understood as a specific SI unit, gas is more abstract. 


## Gas Pricing Service

For accurate pricing, we trim off the lowest price with the fastest time and
highest price with the slowest times until 80% of the
data is represented; these are outliers

 ```js 
/** @dev filter transactions from blocks */
blocks.forEach((block) => {
        block.transactions.forEach((tx) => {
            const price = parseFloat(ethers.utils.formatUnits(tx.gasPrice, "gwei"));
            const duration = tx.waitDuration;
  /** 
  *
  *  Purge anything that takes over an hour 
  */
    if (duration > (60 * 60)) { return; }

    if (duration < (1 * 60)) {
                data.fast.push(price);
        } else if (duration < (5 * 60)) {
                data.medium.push(price);
        } else {
                data.slow.push(price);
        }
```

### Transaction Details 

```js 
/** 
* Add the transaction details
*  @const delta
*  @param waitDuration
*  @param dataLength
*  @param gasLimit
*  @param value
*/
const delta = timestamp - seenTime;
    txs.push({
        w: delta,                                          // waitDuration
        d: ethers.utils.hexDataLength(tx.data),            // dataLength
        l: tx.gasLimit.toString(),                         // gasLimit
        p: ethers.utils.formatUnits(tx.gasPrice, "gwei"),  // gasPrice
        v: ethers.utils.formatUnits(tx.value)              // value
});
```
### Canary Scanning

> Failsafe guard

```js 
    // Canary scanning (check every second)
    // If we go too long without a ne block or a new transaction, it indicates the
    // underlying connection to a backend has probalby disconnected. By exiting,
    // we give our process manager a change to run us again to reconnect
    (setInterval(() => {
        const delta = getTime() - canaryTimer;
        if (delta > MAX_DISCONNECT) {
            console.log(`Canary: forcing restart...`);
            process.exit();
        }
    }, 1000)).unref();
``` 



How to subscribe to gas price changes

```ts
import { Container } from 'typedi';
import EventConstants from '@constants/events';
import EventEmitter from 'events';

const {
  GAS_CHANGE
} = EventConstants;

const events:EventEmitter = Container.get('eventEmitter');
events.on(GAS_CHANGE, (newGasPrice)=>{
  // do something with the newGasPrice
});
```
